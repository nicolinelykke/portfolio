  where i'm currently on my 1. semester.
  I have always worked well together with my creative side and have as long as i can remember
  always been to find with a pen in my hand occupied with creating something new.
  Other than that, in the recent years, i have spent a lot of my time on social medias where i have built a following of
  about 119 thousand followers across my social media accounts. </p></div>
